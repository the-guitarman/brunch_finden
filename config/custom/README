Don't put any essential / system relevant files in here.
This directory is only for instance customizations.
Files in here are typically changeable from BACKEND or through a ssh shell to the server.

On deploy time this directory will be renamed to "custom_templates".
So if you have changed a file and want the changes to be enabled on deployed instance
you have to COPY your changed files from "custom_templates/" to "custom/".
